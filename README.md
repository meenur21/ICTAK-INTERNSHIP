Credit Score Classification Model Development

Background
Welcome to the Credit Score Classification Model Development internship project at ICTAK. In this internship, you will embark on a journey to create a predictive model that categorizes customers into three creditworthiness levels: Good, Standard, and Poor. This model will be a valuable tool for banks and financial institutions to make informed decisions about loan approvals and risk assessment.
